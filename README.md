# Front-End-Mentor
This repo will be used as a hosting place for my Front-End challenges in front-end-Mentor.
The projects were deployed to github pages.
# Access the project
To access the projects, start the url with: 
https://diamo-b.github.io/Front-End-Mentor/
Then add to the link the path of the project inside the repo:
.e.g: I want to access the website for the calculator challenge:
  + this challenge exists inside the folder "intermediate" then the sub-folder "calculator-app-main"
  + This will make the link for the calculator app : https://diamo-b.github.io/Front-End-Mentor/intermediate/calculator-app-main
